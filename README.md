# FromRaw2Linked
This repository has been created to host the project for the Knowledge Reprentation and Extraction course for the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge degree at the University of Bologna under the supervision of Prof. Aldo Gangemi.
The goal of this project is to start from a raw dataset, in this case one regarding musical records and musical artists, to obtain a linked dataset on which it is possible toperform useful and interesting analysis and operations (e.g. link predictionand sentiment analysis). You can find further details and the whole workflow at the repository website: https://alerosae.github.io/FromRaw2Linked/
