# FromRaw2Linked
This repository has been created to host the project for the Knowledge Reprentation and Extraction course for the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge degree at the University of Bologna under the supervision of Prof. Aldo Gangemi.
The goal of this project is to start from a raw dataset, in this case regarding musical records, to obtain a linked dataset on which you can make useful and interesting analysis (e.g. link precition and sentimental analysis). The raw dataset has been extracted from the website RateYourMusic.Com with a JavaScript file that was developed by Simone Del Deo.
